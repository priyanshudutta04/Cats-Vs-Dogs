## About

Are you a cat person or a dog person? This repository delves into the timeless debate with a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for precise classification of images featuring our beloved furry companions. Whether you're captivated by the graceful poise of cats or charmed by the boundless enthusiasm of dogs, this project showcases advanced deep learning techniques applied to the fascinating realm of pet image classification.

Classifying whether images contain a dog or a cat is straightforward for humans and other animals. However, it requires training over a large dataset for computers to distinguish properly.
